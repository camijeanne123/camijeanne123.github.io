        Amazon shows a great example of Hick's law. There are so many different products and categories. Hick's law allows them to focus on the 
        search bar and the menu on the left for navigating through all the products and categories. Without it there would be hundreds of sheets just 
        listing all the different products and categories randomly inefficiently.

      <h4 class="head3">Rule of Thirds</h4>
      <h5 class="head4">FoodNetwork.com</h5>

      <p class="par2">
        FoodNetwork really draws attention to their logo and the recipes that they are showing by using the rule of thirds. You can see that 
        below the add, you see the logo for the website and then below at around 2/3 of the page you see a picture of the dish for the recipe that is 
        being shown. This really catches your eye and has you focus on their key points on the page.

        BYUI is the A+ student of white space and clean design. If you just look at the centering of the log-in area and the borders and white space 
        around it, it just looks clean and simple. They also used colors that allow for clean design.
