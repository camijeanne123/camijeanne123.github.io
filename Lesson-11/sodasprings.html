          <h2>
            Meet the man who has spent his retirement restoring old buildings
          </h2>
          <h6>
            BY MIKE PRICE
          </h6>
          <p>
            SODA SPRINGS — After experiencing personal tragedy, Jerry Stoor
            started restoring old buildings to deal with his grief. One project
            is particularly personal to him. The Henry School was built in 1898
            and served students between Soda Springs and Wayan. It finally
            closed its doors in 1936 and fell into ruin. By 2014 it was being
            used as a sheep camp and the owner of the land had plans to burn it
            down. <br><br>Stoor had an uncle who attended school in the old building and
            he didn’t want to see it destroyed. “I felt like it would be a good
            opportunity to keep me busy and give me something to do. So they
            gave it to me,” Stoor said. Before he could start work restoring the
            schoolhouse, Stoor had to move it to his property in Wayan, about
            seven miles up the road. “A friend of mine and I built a trailer out
            of a mobile home frame and an old machine trailer. We welded it all
            together so it would fit the dimensions of this building,” he
            said.<a
