          The most expansive chill so far this season has swept into much of the United States, ushering in much colder air that has set record lows for mid-October in the West.

This system has also brought a major, potentially record-setting October snowstorm in the Northern Plains.<br>


Very sharp temperature drops have accompanied the front.

After a high of 74 degrees Wednesday afternoon, Cheyenne, Wyoming, experienced wind chills near zero degrees Thursday morning. Denver dropped from a high of 83 degrees Wednesday to a low of 13 degrees Thursday night, a 70-degree temperature change, which ranked as the greatest one- and two-day temperature drops on record for October and tied for the fourth-largest two-day temperature drop for any month in the Mile High City.

Record-cold temperatures have also been set this week.<br>

Great Falls, Montana, dropped to zero degrees Thursday morning, setting a new record for the coldest temperature so early in the season. The previous earliest zero-degree temperature was on Oct. 27, 1925.
